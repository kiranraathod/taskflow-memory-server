# Project Brief: TaskFlow Memory Server

## Overview
The TaskFlow Memory Server is a specialized server designed to provide task management, context maintenance, and memory management with persistent state. This system combines features for task execution and orchestration with a robust Memory Bank architecture for state management across sessions.

## Core Requirements

1. **Task Management**
   - Maintain project tasks and subtasks with status tracking
   - Support task dependencies and prioritization
   - Provide tools for task generation, updating, and analysis

2. **Memory Bank Architecture**
   - Implement a comprehensive Memory Bank system for storing project context
   - Maintain memory files according to the specified structure
   - Support Plan and Act modes for project execution

3. **Context Awareness**
   - Track project context across sessions
   - Provide mechanisms for context updates and retrievals
   - Implement caching for efficient context management

4. **Workflow Integration**
   - Support file system operations
   - Enable integration with external systems
   - Provide tools for task execution

## Technical Goals

1. Implement a robust server architecture based on the FastMCP protocol
2. Integrate Memory Bank functionality into the system core
3. Create tools for memory file maintenance and updates
4. Design for reliability, performance, and scalability
5. Support client-server communication via MCP protocol

## Success Criteria

1. Server correctly initializes with Memory Bank structure
2. Tasks are properly managed and tracked
3. Context is preserved between sessions
4. Memory files are accurately maintained
5. System supports both Plan and Act modes
6. Integration with external workflows works seamlessly
