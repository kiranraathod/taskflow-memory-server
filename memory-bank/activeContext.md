# Active Context: TaskFlow Memory Server

## Current Focus

The current development focus is on implementing the core TaskFlow server with Memory Bank integration. This involves:

1. Setting up the basic server architecture based on the existing codebase
2. Implementing the Memory Manager for Memory Bank operations
3. Integrating the Context Manager with Memory Bank
4. Creating tools for Memory Bank maintenance

## Recent Changes

- Created initial Memory Bank structure with core files
- Established project directory structure
- Analyzed existing implementation for feature integration
- Defined system patterns and technical context
- Renamed from MCP Cloud Desktop to TaskFlow Memory Server

## Active Decisions

### Memory Bank Implementation

The Memory Bank is being implemented as a core service managed by a dedicated Memory Manager component. This component will:

- Provide methods for reading and writing Memory Bank files
- Ensure atomic updates to Memory Bank files
- Validate Memory Bank file content
- Support different file types and formats

**Decision**: Use a singleton Memory Manager to ensure consistent access to Memory Bank files across the application.

### Context Management

Context is being managed through a hybrid approach:

- In-memory cache for frequently accessed context
- Memory Bank files for persistent storage
- Event-driven updates to maintain consistency

**Decision**: Extend the existing Context Manager to support Memory Bank integration.

### Plan/Act Mode Implementation

The system will explicitly support Plan and Act modes:

- Plan mode: Focus on analyzing context and generating plans
- Act mode: Focus on executing specific tasks with context

**Decision**: Implement mode-specific workflows with different tool sets for each mode.

## In Progress

1. Setting up the basic server structure
2. Implementing the Memory Manager
3. Adapting the core for Memory Bank integration
4. Creating tools for Memory Bank operations

## Key Insights

1. The Memory Bank structure provides a natural organization for project documentation
2. Separating Plan and Act modes aligns well with the workflow
3. The existing Context Manager provides a solid foundation for Memory Bank integration
4. Event-driven updates will reduce manual maintenance of Memory Bank files

## Next Steps

1. Implement the Memory Manager component
2. Adapt the Context Manager for Memory Bank integration
3. Create tools for Memory Bank maintenance
4. Implement Plan and Act mode workflows
5. Add workflow integration features

## Open Questions

1. What's the optimal refresh strategy for Memory Bank files?
2. How should conflicts between in-memory context and Memory Bank files be resolved?
3. What's the best approach for handling large Memory Bank files?
4. How should the system handle Memory Bank file versioning?
